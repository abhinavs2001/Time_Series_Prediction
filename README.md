# Time Series Prediction

#Task
I have to predict the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 per section from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

#Model Used
In this project I used Random forest Regresoor Algorithm to predict values of five variables. I used it to predict the values of Para 9,10,11,12,13 and it can be easily seen in the notebook. Then I made some scatter plots of it corresponding to each variable.

Results
The RMSE value of the model is 49.2
